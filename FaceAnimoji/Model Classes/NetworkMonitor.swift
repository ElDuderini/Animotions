//This class is used to check if the app is currently connected to the internet.
//It is needed to prevent crashes associated with utilizing the VERN API without connecting to the internet
//This Script was scrapped since it didn't perform the needs I wanted to.
//While the value would change in real time in this class, I needed that value changed to be picked up in the main menu class.
//I set up a didset property for a bool that was equal to the isConnected bool in this script, but when isConnected changed, it did not trigger the didset propperty for the mainmenu class like I hoped.
//I instead needed to put this network functionality into the main menu view controller
